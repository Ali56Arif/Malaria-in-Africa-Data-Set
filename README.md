# Malaria-in-Africa-Data-Set
Malaria cases, incidence risk, and prevention
About Dataset
Context
Africa, the world's second-largest continent, a continent with a wide array of vibrant cultures each with its own deep history, continent number 2 of largest population, and the continent is home to wonderful wildlife you can spot when you go on safari!
Let's focus on Africa in this dataset.

Malaria is a common disease in Africa. The disease is transmitted to humans through infected mosquito bites. Although you can take preventive measures against malaria, it can be life-threatening. This dataset includes the malaria cases in African countries, the incidence at risk, and data on preventive treatments against malaria.

Content
This dataset includes data on all African countries from 2007 till 2017. Each country has a unique ISO-3 country code, and the dataset includes the latitude and longitude point of each country as well. The dataset includes the cases of malaria that have been reported in each country and each year, as well as data on preventive measures that have been taken to prevent malaria.

Acknowledgements
The data on the incidence of malaria, malaria cases reported, and preventive treatments against malaria have been retrieved from the world bank open data source.

Inspiration
Each country has a unique ISO-3 country code. You can use the ISO-3 code to create choropleth maps and in the geospatial analysis. In addition, the dataset includes latitude and longitude points for each country.

Drinking water safety and sanitation include a risk factor for malaria. Can improved drinking water facilities and preventive measures decrease the risk of malaria infection?
